          This page outlines the structured approach I took in designing and developing this website, including the concept behind the brand, information architecture planning, visual styling, wireframing, prototyping, accessibility considerations, and future improvements.

      <!-- Origin Section -->
      <section>
        <h2>Origin of "Nabeehaâ€™s World"</h2>
        <p>
          The name "Nabeehaâ€™s World" has been a personal brand of mine since high school. What started as a quirky name is now used across my professional and creative platforms, reflecting the multi-dimensional nature of my experiencesâ€”from leadership and marketing work to creative projects and community initiatives. This site serves as a digital extension of that identity.

      <!-- Information Architecture Section -->
      <section>
        <h2>Information Architecture (IA) and Site Navigation Flow</h2>
        <p>
          In alignment with Project 1, I developed a clear IA to guide the site's structure. I used Canva to create a node-link diagram mapping how each page connects and what content would reside where. The core navigation consists of five primary sections: Home, Work Showcase, Resume, Process, and Contact.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach ensured a smooth user experience and maintained clarity throughout the design process.

            This is the initial diagram I created, providing an overview of my planningâ€”even if it evolved during development.

      <!-- Planning & Rationale Section -->
      <section>
        <h2>Planning &amp; Rationale for Design Choices</h2>
        <p>
          I aimed for a clean, personal, and intuitive design, prioritizing readability and flow. My design choices were influenced by my experiences in marketing and digital asset creation for brand campaigns. Starting with a styling kit in Adobe XD helped establish the toneâ€”from colour schemes and font families to hover states and spacing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focused on visual hierarchy, used whitespace deliberately, and selected a muted green accent to evoke calmness and balance.

      <!-- Wireframes Section -->
      <section>
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
          My wireframes, created in Adobe XD, balanced clarity and functionality. They emphasized clear sectioning, aligned content blocks, and logical navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          These wireframes helped me visualize user interactions before moving into prototyping and coding.
        </p>

      <!-- Graphic Prototypes Section -->
      <section>
        <h2>Graphic Design Prototypes</h2>
        <p>
          After wireframing, I built high-fidelity prototypes in Adobe XD that incorporated brand colours, custom icons, and refined text layouts. These prototypes ensured visual consistency throughout development.
        </p>
        <p>

      <!-- Coding Process Section -->
      <section>
        <h2>Coding Process</h2>
        <p>
          I used Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for all coding tasks, which provided a robust development environment. Tools like "Live Server" allowed real-time previews, ensuring my design aligned with functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Extensions such as GitHub Copilot assisted in troubleshooting and refining my code, enhancing my overall workflow.
        </p>
        <div class="responsive-image-container">
          <img src="images/vscode.png" alt="Screenshot of VS Code in use" class="responsive-image" />

      </section>

      <!-- Accessibility Section -->
      <section>
        <h2>Accessibility Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Accessibility was prioritized from the beginning of the design and development process. I aligned the site with WCAG 2.0 and the POUR principles (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust). All images include descriptive alt text, navigation elements are clearly labeled, and colour contrast ratios were tested to meet standards.
        </p>
